# Fix Customer Delete Issue

## Problem
The customer delete functionality is failing with a database error because the Row Level Security (RLS) policy for DELETE operations on the customers table is missing.

## Solution

### Step 1: Add the Missing DELETE Policy

Run this SQL command in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add missing DELETE policy for customers table
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete customers" ON public.customers
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

### Step 2: Verify the Policy

You can verify the policy was added by running:

```sql
-- Check existing policies on customers table
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'customers';
```

### Step 3: Test the Delete Function

After adding the policy, the customer delete functionality should work properly. The delete operation will:

1. Check for related data (meters, bills, payments)
2. Delete the customer (cascade will handle related data)
3. Update the local state
4. Log the activity

## What Was Fixed

1. **Missing DELETE Policy**: Added the RLS policy that allows authenticated users to delete customers
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error logging to provide more detailed information
3. **Better Data Handling**: The function now gets customer details before deletion for proper logging
4. **Cascade Awareness**: Added checks to see if customer has related data that will be cascaded

## Database Relationships

The customer deletion will cascade to:
- **Meters**: All meters belonging to the customer
- **Bills**: All bills for the customer (which will cascade to payments)
- **Payments**: All payments for the customer's bills

This is handled automatically by the `ON DELETE CASCADE` constraints in the database schema.
